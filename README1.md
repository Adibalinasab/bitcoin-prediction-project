# Bitcoin Price Prediction Analysis
## 🚀 Project Overview
A machine learning implementation using **Gradient Boosting** to analyze Bitcoin price trends. 
This project explores the iterative error-correction process in predictive modeling.
## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python
- **Algorithm:** Gradient Boosting (Scikit-Learn)
  - **Data:**Historical BTC/USD Prices
  - **Visualization:** Matplotlib
📈 Learning Process
The model starts with a simple mean and progressively adds 500 decision trees.
Each tree focuses on the **Residuals** (errors) of the previous stage, refining the prediction through
 a controlled **Learning Rate**
